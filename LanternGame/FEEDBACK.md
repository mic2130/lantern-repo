# CODE

There are a variety of interesting technical problems you guys solved in this project and I'm really happy to see it come together. Things like thinking of progress as a spatial computed output, to the wide range of different RiotJS features utilized, to the data architecture and component hierarchy and how they talk-y to each other. Also, there is a lot of sophisticated CSS here which I think some of you spent considerable time exploring. These aren't trivial things and not only did you try to solve these things, for the most part you did. The final quality of the overall experience is notable and something I think you should be proud of.

You've only been "dabbling" with this stuff for a class, for only a year. I'm not sure whether people recognize this but this is a lot for a the span of time we're talking about. I state with 100% honesty when I say I did not have nearly the kind of understanding about this stuff as you did the first year I started programming on my own.

Based on the kind of code I see, I think you demonstrate a very respectable understanding of not just the higher-level tools like RiotJS, but also the fundamentals of programming such as state, sequence, causality. It's details I see in the kind of programming choices you make that emphasize this understanding. The way you piece the parts together, are well thought out.

If I had to criticize (more like suggest for the future) the code, I think it would be something along the lines of thinking about ways in which we could be even more concise. For this class, the "right answer" is the "answer that works." But as we found out in our talks and work together this year, there is often more than one answer to programming problems. I think, thinking of ways to make your code even more efficient/concise might be an effort worth thinking about to get to the "next level."

Finally, I do appreciate the time you spent together as a team working out many of these programming things.

# DESIGN

You guys worked pretty hard to put together a clean design document which I appreciate. In general you break it up into the different levels of abstraction like we talked about and while a real design document tends to be much more detailed and probably, lengthy - the way you articulate your design here is clear enough that it gives me a good idea of what it is you're building. I like the test that you conducted on your users to get some insight into this phenomenon - which is a great precursor to the actual design doc itself. Overall this document shows a lot of project organization and vision as to what this project actually is, while sticking to the objective which is really the point.


# OVERALL

Overall, your team and teamwork represented the best of what can happen I think, when it comes to having this sort of project across an entire semester. I appreciate the hard work and interesting technical aspects you guys challenged yourselves to as well as the polish you put onto your final submission. While this project is only a small glimpse into what working on a "real", "larger" scale project might be like, I think for what it is - you guys executed it well as a team. I really appreciated having you all in my class and enjoyed the time very much. I hope you continue your work "making cool things" and that this course helped you to see how capable you all really are.
